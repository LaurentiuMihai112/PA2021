//scoring and winner were already done
added a wait-notify appproach for the players, before i was using join
added manual player (only bots were available before)
bot has a "smart approach" trying to find the best available token to create a sequence, at the same time choosing the highest valued token (that satisfies the first criteria)
added timer with a daemon thread that stops the game after a fixed amount of time
